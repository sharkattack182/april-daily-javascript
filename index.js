// Balanced Words
// We can assign a value to each character in a word, based on their position in the alphabet (a = 1, b = 2, ... , z = 26). A balanced word is one where the sum of values on the left-hand side of the word equals the sum of values on the right-hand side. For odd length words, the middle character (balance point) is ignored.
